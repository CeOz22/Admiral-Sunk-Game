# About Game
This is a game you can play with your friends.

## %
It's completely finished.

### Roadmap
I'll update it when I have new ideas for the game. For example, I want to add visual graphics soon.

### About project
It's not my first project in C++, but it's my most advanced project. I started this when I was just beginning. I added to the project as I learned new things. Sometimes I went through very difficult times. I was confused about how to add a feature and how to make it work correctly. But in the end, I completed this project. 

It's my first project on GitHub.
